## Short Summary 
- Support the Centrifuge project in its development and growth
- Request as an API node service provider for the Altair & Centrifuge network free of charge for the first 6 months

## High level objective 
- Provide an API endpoint that is completely independent of one of the major cloud providers

## Background 
Support the decentralized approach of the Centrifuge network, because our operations, IP connectivity and server systems are definitely not depending on one of the major centralized cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, OVHcloud, Hetzner, etc.)

## Description of Activity 
Provide an fast reliable API endpoint that is completely independent of one of the major cloud providers

## Change or improvement 
Diversification of Altair & Centrifuge API services and creation of redundancy

## Alignment to the mission of Centrifuge DAO
Real decentralization is one of the declared goals of the Centrifuge DAO, which we hereby support

## Description of Group
- We have been in IT since 2001, starting in the Web 1.0 world and compiling Linux systems ourself (Kernel 2.2), quickly realizing that IT and network infrastructure is our strength. 
- Already in 2004 we have been operating our own linux routers, switches and LAMP servers in data centers. 
- Since 2015 we operate our own autonomous system (AS) and geo-redundant data center infrastructure in the center of Europe and can provide fast reliable services that are completely independent.
- We also have our own IPv4- and IPv6-address ranges, which we announce via internet protocol BGP to ensure geo-redundant connectivity of the systems we operate. So we really support the decentralized approach of the Centrifuge network, because our operations, IP connectivity and server systems are definitely not depending on one of the major centralized cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, OVHcloud, Hetzner, etc.).

## Budget
Free of charge. No budget is requested.

## Delivery and Reporting
- If approved, beginning March 2023 our API services will be available free of charge for the first 6 months
- We will then provide an evaluation of the API usage and make a further proposal at which fair market costs we can provide the service in future
